Question:
Should you use a sequential or binary search on an array of Point objects, and why?

Answer:
If we just use Java's Point object we would only be able to use sequential search, since Point does not implement the Comparable interface (or Comparator class) needed for sorting data.
If we asume that we implement the Comparable ourselves and the array is sorted, we should use a binary search, since a Point is now comparable.
Binary search is faster since it uses O(log n), instead of the sequential O(n).
So the optimal solution is implementing the Comparable interface and using binary, but per default, sequential is the solution.
