Ch 13 - Exercise 4
Question:
To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong? Consider N to be the length or size of the array or
collection passed to the method. Explain your reasoning.

public static int[] mystery1(int[] list) {
    int[] result = new int[2 * list.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        result[2 * i] = list[i] / 2 + list[i] % 2;
        result[2 * i + 1] = list[i] / 2;
    }
    return result;
}

Answer:
O(N)

We pass the parameter list with a size of N
we only use a single for loop wich uses the length of list, ergo N
