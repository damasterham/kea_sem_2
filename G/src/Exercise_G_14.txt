Ch 13 - Exercise 5
Question:
To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong?
public static void mystery2(int[] list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.length / 2; i++) {
        int j = list.length – 1 – i;
        int temp = list[i];
        list[i] = list[j];
        list[j] = temp;
    }
}

Answer:
O(N/2)

Since we are using the list length divided by 2 in the for loop
