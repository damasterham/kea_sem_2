Ch 13 - Selfcheck 9.
Question:
Approximate the runtime of the following code fragment, in terms of n:

int sum = 0;		2
int j = 1;
while (j <= n) {	2*log2(N)
  sum++;			
  j = j * 2;
}

Answer:
2*log2(N)+2

could also be considered to be
log2(n)+1
since to of the statements could be considered part of the loop, ergo:
int sum = 0;
for (int j =1; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
  sum++;
}
