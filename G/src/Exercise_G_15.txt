Ch 13 - Exercise 6
Question:
To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong?
public static void mystery3(List<String> list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() â€“ 1; i += 2) {
        String first = list.remove(i);
        list.add(i + 1, first);
    }
}

Answer:
0(N/2)

Since we use the list size, but iterate up by 2, so the operations will be halved.
the size does not change, since we are both removing and adding again
