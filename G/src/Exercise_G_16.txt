Ch 13 - Exercise 7
Question:
To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong?
public static void mystery4(List<String> list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.size() â€“ 1; i += 2) {
        String first = list.get(i);
        list.set(i, list.get(i + 1));
        list.set(i + 1, first);
    }
}

O(N/2)

Does the same thing as the exercise before, just uses set instead of removing and adding.
