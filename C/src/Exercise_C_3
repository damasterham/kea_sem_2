The difference in the 2 styles is

one handles it with unexpected "exceptional" events
where we are expecting certain values to be correct,
but when they aren't we throw the problem back to something that can handle it.

and the other handles it with flow of control, where we
know the various expected outcomes and handle them appropriatly.
None of it is exceptional.


The code using exception is the one that obtains design rules explained by
the family and door salesman example.
