Question: (Ch9 Inherintace - Interfaces & abstract class)
After implementing an interface or extending an abstract class (with abstract methods), 
what do you need to do so your class will work and compile?

1) add an empty constructor
2) override methods as private methods
3) override methods as public methods
4) add the same fields as the parent
5) it already works

Answer:
3) Overriding the methods defined by the interface or abstract class as public.
They cannot be private as it makes no sense since the whole point of 
interface- and abstract methods is polymorphism, that they
are used by other classes and not just themselves.
